Hey, I have no idea how to ask questions about code on github so this was my best idea. I'm trying to use your code within
a project, but I'm running into problems making it work. In your readme, you have a reference to connectSocket, which doesn't
seem to appear in the spotifyconnectws file anywhere. I assume it is a method of some sort, that ties together the web sockets
and spotify? Did it get left out of the code for some reason, or is it some strange placeholder made up by babel? 

Hope you see this, I'd love to be able to monitor playback with spotify. Hopefully they put out a more complete api soon!

Thanks,
Bryn
